# My Workflow Scripts

Don't judge me, these are bits of scripts to semi automate janky stuff I've had to do repeatedly over the years.

Usually created in haste, but nonetheless they should be version controlled so I'm sticking them here.

All scripts are prefixed with `ws_` to avoid clashing with any native binaries and for tabby goodness.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karlbaillie/workflow_scripts.git $HOME/.local/workflow_scripts
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:\$HOME/.local/workflow_scripts\"" >> ~/.zshrc
exec zsh
```
